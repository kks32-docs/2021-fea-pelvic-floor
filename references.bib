  title    = "Neandertal birth canal shape and the evolution of human

  author   = "Weaver, Timothy D and Hublin, Jean-Jacques",
  abstract = "Childbirth is complicated in humans relative to other primates.
              Unlike the situation in great apes, human neonates are about the
              same size as the birth canal, making passage difficult. The birth
              mechanism (the series of rotations that the neonate must undergo
              to successfully negotiate its mother's birth canal) distinguishes
              humans not only from great apes, but also from lesser apes and
              monkeys. Tracing the evolution of human childbirth is difficult,
              because the pelvic skeleton, which forms the margins of the birth
              canal, tends to survive poorly in the fossil record. Only 3
              female individuals preserve fairly complete birth canals, and
              they all date to earlier phases of human evolution. Here we
              present a virtual reconstruction of a female Neandertal pelvis
              from Tabun, Israel. The size of Tabun's reconstructed birth canal
              indicates that childbirth was about as difficult in Neandertals
              as in present-day humans, but the canal's shape indicates that
              Neandertals had a more primitive birth mechanism. A significant
              shift in childbirth apparently occurred quite late in human
              evolution, during the last few hundred thousand years. Such a
              late shift underscores the uniqueness of human childbirth and the
              divergent evolutionary trajectories of Neandertals and the
              lineage leading to present-day humans.",

               alleviates the obstetric dilemma",
  author    = "Fischer, Barbara and Mitteroecker, Philipp",
  abstract  = "Compared with other primates, childbirth is remarkably difficult
               in humans because the head of a human neonate is large relative
               to the birth-relevant dimensions of the maternal pelvis. It
               seems puzzling that females have not evolved wider pelvises
               despite the high maternal mortality and morbidity risk connected
               to childbirth. Despite this seeming lack of change in average
               pelvic morphology, we show that humans have evolved a complex
               link between pelvis shape, stature, and head circumference that
               was not recognized before. The identified covariance patterns
               contribute to ameliorate the ``obstetric dilemma.'' Females with
               a large head, who are likely to give birth to neonates with a
               large head, possess birth canals that are shaped to better
               accommodate large-headed neonates. Short females with an
               increased risk of cephalopelvic mismatch possess a rounder
               inlet, which is beneficial for obstetrics. We suggest that these
               covariances have evolved by the strong correlational selection
               resulting from childbirth. Although males are not subject to
               obstetric selection, they also show part of these association
               patterns, indicating a genetic--developmental origin of

              subject-specific finite element model of human pelvic floor and
              fetal head was developed based on in vivo MRI data of a fetal
              head and maternal pelvis. An anisotropic visco-hyperelastic
              constitutive model employed material parameters estimated from
              biaxial tests on pelvic floor tissues. Boundary conditions
              reflected both anatomic constraints and the curve of Carus. A
              short second stage of labor, scaled to 10 min, was then simulated
              using a single expulsive push made in the absence of levator
              co-contraction. RESULTS: Large levator stresses occurred near the
              levator hiatus reaching 9 MPa at the pubovisceral muscle
              enthesis. The dominant principal stresses were located at, and
              aligned with, the edge of the hiatus. Muscle stretch bordering
              the levator hiatus was inhomogeneous: the average levator stretch
              was 3.55 with a high of 4.64 at the pubovisceral muscle enthesis.
              Decreasing perineal body stiffness by 40\%, 50\%, and 60\% led to
              reductions in the maximum principal stretch ratio at the

              respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pubovisceral muscle enthesis and
              the muscle near the perineal body are the regions of greatest
              strain thereby placing them at highest risk for stretch-related
              injury. Decreasing perineal body tissue stiffness significantly

              determine whether the three-dimensional shape of the bony pelvis
              differs between women with and without pelvic floor disorders
              (PFDs). We predict that the levator ani attachment points for the
              pelvic floor are further displaced from one another in affected
              relative to unaffected women. METHODS: Pelvic shape was
              quantified by collecting coordinate data from landmarks located
              on three-dimensional reconstructions of magnetic resonance images
              of 19 PFD cases and 16 matched controls. Euclidean distance
              matrix analysis (EDMA) was used to quantify and compare pelvic
              shape using these landmark data. RESULTS: There were no
              significant group differences in age, parity, body mass, racial
              attribution, cesarean section, or hysterectomy status. After
              controlling for size as a confounding factor, EDMA results
              identified significant differences (p = 0.05) in the bispinous
              diameter (4 \% proportionally larger) and distances defining
              lateral displacement of ischia from pubis (5-6 \% proportionally
              larger) in cases compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic shape
              in women with PFDs is characterized by the proportional
              mediolateral enlargement of the pelvic midplane and ischial
              eversion near the subpubic arch, consistent with inferolateral
              migration of the attachment points for the levator ani and
              correspondingly lateral displacement. These movements may result
              in increased strain on the pelvic floor's muscular and connective
              tissues, increasing the risk of failure over a woman's lifetime.",

  abstract = "The role of the pelvic floor soft tissues during the second stage
              of labor, particularly the levator ani muscle, has attracted much
              interest recently. It has been postulated that the passage of the
              fetal head through the pelvis may cause excessive stretching of
              the levator ani muscle, which may lead to pelvic floor
              dysfunction and pelvic organ prolapse later in life. In order to
              study the complex biomechanical interactions between the levator
              ani muscle and the fetal head during the second stage of labor,
              finite element models have been developed for quantitative
              analysis of this process. In this study we have simulated vaginal
              delivery using individual-specific anatomical computer models of
              the pelvic floor interacting with a fetal head model with minimal
              restrictions placed upon its motion. Two constitutive relations
              were considered for the levator ani muscle (of exponential and
              neo-Hookean forms). For comparison purposes, the exponential
              relation was chosen to exhibit much greater stiffening at higher
              strains beyond the range of the experimental data. We
              demonstrated that increased nonlinearity in the elastic response
              of the tissues leads to considerably higher (56\%) estimated
              force required for delivery, accompanied by a more homogeneous
              spatial distribution of maximum principal stretch ratio across
              the muscle. These results indicate that the form of constitutive
              relation beyond the presently available experimental data
              markedly affects the estimated function of the levator ani muscle
              during vaginal delivery, due to the large strains that occur.
              Further experimental data at higher strains are necessary in
              order to more reliably characterize the constitutive behavior
              required for modeling vaginal childbirth.",

              Pelvic floor pathology is varied and frequent, especially in the
              elderly, and it is a common cause of consultation among various
              specialties. MRI has gone beyond other complementary methods in
              the study of the pathology of this region. The combination of
              morphological and dinamic information during different
              physiological events results in better diagnostics than simply
              adding the data, since the correlation of dynamic dysfunction

              studied with MR defecography (MRD), and to define specific
              threshold values for pelvic floor descent during the defecation
              phase. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients (mean age 51
              $\pm$ 19.4) with obstructed defecation and 20 healthy volunteers
              (mean age 33.4 $\pm$ 11.5) underwent 3.0T MRD in supine position
              using midsagittal T2-weighted images. Two radiologists performed
              measurements in reference to PCL-lines in straining and during
              defecation. In order to identify cutoff values of pelvic floor
              measurements for diagnosis of pathologic pelvic floor descent
              [anterior, middle, and posterior compartments (AC, MC, PC)],
              receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted.
              RESULTS: Pelvic floor descent of all three compartments was
              significantly larger during defecation than at straining in
              patients and healthy volunteers (p < 0.002). When grading pelvic
              floor descent in the straining phase, only two healthy volunteers
              showed moderate PC descent (10\%), which is considered
              pathologic. However, when applying the grading system during
              defecation, PC descent was overestimated with 50\% of the healthy
              volunteers (10 of 20) showing moderate PC descent. The AUC for PC
              measurements during defecation was 0.77 (p = 0.003) and suggests
              a cutoff value of 45 mm below the PCL to identify patients with
              pathologic PC descent. With the adapted cutoff, only 15\% of
              healthy volunteers show pathologic PC descent during defecation.
              CONCLUSION: MRD measurements during straining and defecation can
              be used to differentiate patients with pelvic floor dysfunction
              from healthy volunteers. However, different cutoff values should

              properties, boundary conditions and loading. In this contribution
              we focus on the relative influence of the inaccuracies in
              geometry description and of uncertainty of patient-specific
              material properties of soft connective tissues. We conducted a
              comparative study using several constitutive behavior laws and
              variations in geometry description resulting from the imprecision
              of clinical imaging and image analysis. We find that geometry
              seems to have the dominant effect on the pelvic organ mobility
              simulation results. Provided that proper finite deformation
              non-linear FE solution procedures are used, the influence of the
              functional form of the constitutive law might be for practical
              purposes negligible. These last findings confirm similar results
              from the fields of modeling neurosurgery and abdominal aortic
              aneurysms.",

  author   = "Kuthe, Chetan D and Uddanwadiker, Rashmi V",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Existing studies have included little discussion of
              anisotropic and material non linearity of muscle tissue, and
              fiber orientation-based material properties of skeletal muscle
              tissue are not reported well in literature. There has been some
              dispute about material response of muscle in different fiber
              directions. It is necessary to have a better understanding of
              fiber orientation based material properties of skeletal muscle,
              to ensure the accuracy of computational models of muscle. To this
              end, the aim of this study was to investigate fiber
              orientation-based material properties in vitro and simulate them
              with finite element analysis (FEA). METHODS: Tensile testing was
              performed on 5 samples of skeletal muscle from a goat at a strain
              rate of 0.15 s-1 with fiber orientation along the length (P) and
              45° incline to the fiber direction (I). FEA was completed using
              the experimental condition to validate the results of the in
              vitro test. The cross-fiber direction was simulated using FEA.
              RESULTS: The stresses for all fiber directions at maximum stretch
              were 1,973.2 kPa for fiber direction P, 1,172 kPa for direction I
              and 430 kPa for the cross-fiber direction. The tensile strengths
              of the skeletal muscle were 0.44 MPa for P and 0.234 MPa for I.
              The elastic modulus of muscle tissue in all fiber directions was
              1.59 MPa for fiber direction P (Ep), 0.621 MPa for 45° direction
              I (EI) and 0.43 MPa for the cross-fiber direction (Ec). The
              displacement of the muscle sample against the maximum load was
              small along the fiber direction. The results of the present study
              showed that muscle tissue was stiffer in the fiber direction than
              in the cross-fiber direction. CONCLUSIONS: The stiffness of
              skeletal muscle is changed as the fiber orientation of skeletal
              muscle tissue changed.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The ``obstetrical dilemma'' hypothesis assumes that
              the modern human female pelvis serves two discrete functions:
              obstetrics and locomotion. We investigate whether these differing
              functions create observable patterns of morphological covariation
              and whether those patterns differ by height, weight, and age.
              This allows evaluation of evidence for canalization and
              phenotypic plasticity relevant to obstetric and locomotor
              function among a living female population. METHODS: Landmarks (N
              = 86) were collected and inter-landmark distances were calculated
              (N = 36) on the pelvis and proximal femur of CT scans of living
              women aged 20 to 90 years (M = 93) receiving a routine CT scan.
              Partial least squares and relative SD of eigenvalues analyses
              were used to evaluate integration overall and within locomotor
              and obstetric modules, respectively. Ordinary Least Squared
              regression was used to evaluate scaling relationships between
              inter-landmark distances and height, weight, and age. RESULTS:
              The obstetric pelvis was significantly less internally integrated
              than the locomotor pelvis. Many obstetric measurements were
              constrained in absolute terms relative to height; shorter women
              had relatively larger birth canal dimensions, and several key
              obstetric dimensions showed relative freedom from height. Lower
              weight women had some relatively larger obstetric and locomotor
              dimensions. Regarding age, younger women showed a few relatively
              larger outlet dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that
              the obstetric pelvis and the locomotor pelvis function are
              morphologically distinct, with the obstetric pelvis showing
              relatively greater flexibility. These relationships between
              relative constraints support the hypothesis that the modern
              female pelvis shows evidence of both canalization and phenotypic
              plasticity in obstetric and locomotor structures.",

  abstract = "Schultz ([1949] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 7:401-424) presented a
              conundrum: among primates, sexual dimorphism of the pelvis is a
              developmental adjunct to dimorphism in other aspects of the body,
              albeit in the converse direction. Among species in which males
              are larger than females in body size, females are larger than
              males in some pelvic dimensions; species with little sexual
              dimorphism in nonpelvic size show little pelvic dimorphism.
              Obstetrical difficulty does not explain this relationship. The
              present study addresses this issue, evaluating the relationship
              between pelvic and femoral sexual dimorphism in 12 anthropoid
              species. The hypothesis is that species in which males are
              significantly larger than females in femoral size will have a
              higher incidence, magnitude, and variability of pelvic sexual
              dimorphism, with females having relatively larger pelves than
              males, compared with species monomorphic in femoral size. The
              results are consistent with the hypothesis. The proposed
              explanation is that the default pelvic anatomy in adulthood is
              that of the female; testosterone redirects growth from the
              default type to that of the male by differentially enhancing and
              repressing growth among the pelvic dimensions. Testosterone also
              influences sexual dimorphism of the femur. The magnitude of the
              pelvic response to testosterone is greater in species that are
              sexually dimorphic in the femur than in those that are
              monomorphic.",

              have pelvic floor dysfunction so severe that it will require
              surgery. Several studies have shown that pelvic floor injuries

              in the development of urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence,
              and pelvic organ prolapse. The objective of the present work is
              to contribute to the clarification of the mechanisms behind
              pelvic floor disorders related to a vaginal delivery. For this
              purpose, a numerical simulation based on the finite element
              method was carried out. The finite element model intends to
              represent the effects that the passage of a fetal head can induce
              on the muscles of the pelvic floor, from a mechanical point of
              view. The model used for the simulation represents the pelvic

              this work, we simulated the movements of the fetus during birth,

               rectovaginal septum are the result of childbirth. However,
               rectoceles do occur in women who have never delivered vaginally.
               AIMS: To determine the incidence of rectocele in a cohort of
               asymptomatic, young nulliparous women. METHODS: Observational
               cohort study on 178 nulliparous caucasian women (aged 18-24)
               recruited for a twin study of pelvic floor dysfunction. All
               women were interviewed and examined by translabial ultrasound,
               supine and after voiding. In 52 women, 3D imaging was obtained
               and 171 datasets were complete and available for analysis.
               Ultrasound findings were reviewed for rectovaginal septal
               integrity by an assessor blinded against interview and
               demographic data for rectovaginal septal integrity. RESULTS: A
               discontinuity of the anterior rectal wall with extrusion of
               rectal mucosa or contents (depth of >or= 10 mm) was observed in
               21/171 (12\%). The depth of this herniation ranged from 10 to 25
               mm and was filled with stool (n = 10) or rectal mucosa (n = 11).
               Defects were associated with a higher BMI (P = 0.049), with the
               complaint of constipation (P = 0.049) and non-significantly with
               straining at stool (P = 0.09). Descent of the ampulla to beyond

               is, significant perineal relaxation, was observed in 23/171

              with no signs or symptoms of pelvic support defects underwent CT

              intertuberous diameter of the pelvic outlet were measured. Post
              hoc power analysis showed that 22 women were needed in each group

              groups, with an alpha error of 1\% and a beta error of 10\%,

              the bony pelvis differs between women with and without pelvic
              floor disorders. Methods We designed a case-control study of
              women who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
              pelvis at our institution. Records were reviewed to identify
              women with and without pelvic floor disorders (urinary or anal
              incontinence, other symptoms of urinary tract dysfunction, or
              pelvic organ prolapse). Pelvimetry techniques were standardized.
              Relevant measures included transverse diameter of the inlet,
              angle of the pubic arch, intertuberous diameter, interspinous
              diameter, sacrococcygeal length, depth of sacral curvature,
              anteroposterior conjugate, obstetrical conjugate, and
              anteroposterior outlet. Multiple logistic regression analysis was
              used to identify women with pelvic floor disorders as a function
              of their pelvic dimensions, controlling for potentially
              confounding variables. Results Subjects included 59 women with
              pelvic floor disorders and 39 women without pelvic floor
              disorders. Women with pelvic floor disorders had a wider
              transverse inlet, wider intertuberous diameter, wider
              interspinous diameter, greater sacrococcygeal length, deeper

              A wide transverse inlet and narrow obstetrical conjugate are
              associated with pelvic floor disorders. We speculate that these
              features of bony pelvic architecture may predispose the patient

              early ``erectus-like'' specimens has been described, but never
              satisfactorily explained. Here the functional relationships
              between pelvic and femoral structure in humans are explored using
              both theoretical biomechanical models and empirical tests within
              modern samples of diverse body form (Pecos Amerindians, East
              Africans). Results indicate that a long femoral neck increases
              mediolateral bending of the femoral diaphysis and decreases
              gluteal abductor and hip joint reaction forces. Increasing
              biacetabular breadth along with femoral neck length further
              increases M-L bending of the femoral shaft and maintains abductor
              and joint reaction forces at near ``normal'' levels. When
              compared to modern humans, Homo erectus and early
              ``erectus-like'' specimens are characterized by a long femoral
              neck and greatly increased M-L relative to A-P bending strength
              of the femoral shaft, coupled with no decrease in hip joint size
              and a probable increase in abductor force relative to body size.
              All of this strongly suggests that biacetabular breadth as well
              as femoral neck length was relatively large in early Homo.
              Several features preserved in early Homo partial hip bones also
              indicate that the true (lower) pelvis was very M-L broad, as well
              as A-P narrow. This is similar to the lower pelvic shape of
              australopithecines and suggests that nonrotational birth, in
              which the newborn's head is oriented transversely through the
              pelvic outlet, characterized early Homo as well as
              Australopithecus. Because M-L breadth of the pelvis is
              constrained by other factors, this may have limited increases in
              cranial capacity within Homo until rotational birth was
              established during the late Middle Pleistocene. During or after
              the transition to rotational birth biacetabular breadth
              decreased, reducing the body weight moment arm about the hip and
              allowing femoral neck length (abductor moment arm) to also
              decrease, both of which reduced M-L bending of the proximal
              femoral shaft. Variation in femoral structural properties within
              early Homo and other East African Early Pleistocene specimens has
              several taxonomic and phylogenetic implications.",

  abstract = "A broad pelvis is characteristic of most, if not all, pre-modern
              hominins. In at least some early australopithecines, most notably
              the female Australopithecus afarensis specimen known as ``Lucy,''
              it is very broad and coupled with very short lower limbs. In
              1991, Rak suggested that Lucy's pelvic anatomy improved locomotor
              efficiency by increasing stride length through rotation of the
              wide pelvis in the axial plane. Compared to lengthening strides
              by increasing flexion and extension at the hips, this mechanism
              could avoid potentially costly excessive vertical oscillations of
              the body's center of mass (COM). Here, we test this hypothesis.
              We examined 3D kinematics of walking at various speeds in 26
              adult subjects to address the following questions: Do individuals
              with wider pelves take longer strides, and do they use a smaller
              degree of hip flexion and extension? Is pelvic rotation greater
              in individuals with shorter legs, and those with narrower pelves?
              Our results support Rak's hypothesis. Subjects with wider pelves
              do take longer strides for a given velocity, and for a given
              stride length they flex and extend their hips less, suggesting a
              smoother pathway of the COM. Individuals with shorter legs do use
              more pelvic rotation when walking, but pelvic breadth was not
              related to pelvic rotation. These results suggest that a broad
              pelvis could benefit any bipedal hominin, but especially a
              short-legged australopithecine such as Lucy, by improving
              locomotor efficiency, particularly when carrying an infant or
              traveling in a foraging group with individuals of varying sizes.

               surfaces even though many stabilizing selection gradients
               deviate from symmetry. Here we revisit Lande's adaptive
               landscape and introduce novel analytical theory that includes
               asymmetric selection. Asymmetric selection and the resulting
               skewed trait distributions bias equilibrium mean phenotypes away

               excessive defences against enemies. These so-called
               extraordinary defences can evolve in response to asymmetrical
               selection when marginal risks of insufficient defence exceed

              hypothesized to be the result of evolutionary constraints on
              obstetric dimensions related to bipedalism and/or
              thermoregulation in later hominins. Previous attempts to test
              such hypotheses have used biomechanical methods and results have
              been mixed. But evolutionary constraints, restrictions or
              limitations on the course or outcome of evolution, are the result
              of an interaction between selective pressures and genetic
              constraints---the latter revealed in patterns of integration.
              Integration between traits can result in directional or
              stabilizing selection on one trait leading to correlated
              responses in other traits, which can bias and constrain
              evolutionary trajectories. Therefore, trait evolution may be
              constrained for reasons separate from those that can be estimated
              using biomechanical models, and to study evolutionary constraints
              it is necessary to understand the role genetic constraints play
              in morphological change. The results presented here show that
              genetic constraints can significantly reduce the evolutionary
              potential of the birth canal to evolve in humans, apes, and
              likely earlier hominins, but also point to an overall reduction
              in the level of constraints during hominin evolution. These
              findings suggest that divergent selection pressures for obstetric
              requirements and other pelvic functions in hominins reduced
              levels of genetic constraint on birth canal evolution, likely
              lowering the amount of time needed for evolutionary change, and
              permitting morphological evolution along a trajectory that might
              have previously been difficult or impossible to traverse.",

  abstract = "In the field of computational biomechanics, investigators have
              primarily used commercial software that is neither geared toward
              biological applications nor sufficiently flexible to follow the
              latest developments in the field. This lack of a tailored
              software environment has hampered research progress, as well as
              dissemination of models and results. To address these issues, we
              developed the FEBio software suite
              (http://mrl.sci.utah.edu/software/febio), a nonlinear implicit
              finite element (FE) framework, designed specifically for analysis
              in computational solid biomechanics. This paper provides an
              overview of the theoretical basis of FEBio and its main features.
              FEBio offers modeling scenarios, constitutive models, and
              boundary conditions, which are relevant to numerous applications
              in biomechanics. The open-source FEBio software is written in
              C++, with particular attention to scalar and parallel performance
              on modern computer architectures. Software verification is a
              large part of the development and maintenance of FEBio, and to
              demonstrate the general approach, the description and results of
              several problems from the FEBio Verification Suite are presented
              and compared to analytical solutions or results from other
              established and verified FE codes. An additional simulation is
              described that illustrates the application of FEBio to a research
              problem in biomechanics. Together with the pre- and
              postprocessing software PREVIEW and POSTVIEW, FEBio provides a

               The prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary
               incontinence, overactive bladder, and anal incontinence was
               assessed in a random sample of women aged 25-84 years by using
               the validated Epidemiology of Prolapse and Incontinence
               Questionnaire. Women were categorized as nulliparous, vaginally
               parous, or only delivered by cesarean. Adjusted odds ratios and
               95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for each disorder were
               calculated with logistic regression, controlling for age, body
               mass index, and parity. RESULTS: In the 4,458 respondents the
               prevalence of each disorder was as follows: 7\% prolapse, 15\%
               stress urinary incontinence, 13\% overactive bladder, 25\% anal
               incontinence, and 37\% for any one or more pelvic floor
               disorders. There were no significant differences in the
               prevalence of disorders between the cesarean delivery and
               nulliparous groups. The adjusted odds of each disorder increased
               with vaginal parity compared with cesarean delivery: prolapse =
               1.82 (95\% CI 1.04-3.19), stress urinary incontinence = 1.81
               (95\% CI 1.25-2.61), overactive bladder = 1.53 (95\% CI
               1.02-2.29), anal incontinence = 1.72 (95\% CI 1.27-2.35), and
               any one or more pelvic floor disorders = 1.85 (95\% CI
               1.42-2.41). Number-needed-to-treat analysis revealed that 7
               women would have to deliver only by cesarean delivery to prevent
               one woman from having a pelvic floor disorder. CONCLUSION: The
               risk of pelvic floor disorders is independently associated with
               vaginal delivery but not with parity alone. Cesarean delivery
               has a protective effect, similar to nulliparity, on the
               development of pelvic floor disorders when compared with vaginal
               delivery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2.",

               organ systems. The best known, and most common, of these
               injuries is obstetric fistula formation. When obstructed labor
               is unrelieved, the presenting fetal part is impacted against the
               soft tissues of the pelvis and a widespread ischemic vascular
               injury develops that results in tissue necrosis and subsequent
               fistula formation. Unlike the postsurgical vesicovaginal
               fistula, however, which is usually the result of focal trauma to
               otherwise healthy tissues, the obstetric fistula is the result
               of a ``field injury'' to a broad area. The field injury that is
               produced by prolonged obstructed labor may result in multiple
               birth-related injuries in addition to (or instead of) a
               vesicovaginal fistula. Focusing simply on the ``hole'' between
               the bladder and the vagina ignores the multifaceted nature of
               the injury that many of these patients have sustained. These

               problems, including divorce, exclusion from religious
               activities, separation from their families, worsening poverty,
               malnutrition, and almost unendurable suffering. Isolated almost
               exclusively to the developing world, particularly Africa, this

              Serial magnetic resonance images from a healthy nulliparous
              34-year-old woman, published anatomic data, and engineering
              graphics software were used to construct a structural model of
              the levator ani muscles along with related passive tissues. The
              model was used to quantify pelvic floor muscle stretch induced
              during the second stage of labor as a model fetal head
              progressively engaged and then stretched the iliococcygeus,
              pubococcygeus, and puborectalis muscles. RESULTS: The largest
              tissue strain reached a stretch ratio (tissue length under
              stretch/original tissue length) of 3.26 in medial pubococcygeus

              the medical school of Oporto. These studies are motivated by the
              pelvic floor dysfunctions that lead namely to urinary
              incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. This research ultimately
              aims at: (i) contributing to clarify the primary mechanism behind
              such disorders; (ii) providing tools to simulate the pelvic floor
              function and the effects of its dysfunctions; (iii) contributing
              to planning and performing surgeries in a more controlled and
              reliable way. The finite element meshes of the levator ani are
              based on a publicly available geometric data set, and use
              triangular thin shell or special brick elements. Muscle and soft
              tissues are assumed as (quasi-)incompressible hyperelastic
              materials. Skeletal muscles are transversely isotropic with a
              single fiber direction, embedded in an isotropic matrix. The
              fibers considered in this work may be purely passive, or active
              with input of neuronal excitation and consideration of the muscle
              activation process. The first assumption may be adequate to
              simulate passive deformations of the pelvic muscles and tissues
              (namely, under the extreme loading conditions of childbirth). The
              latter may be adequate to model faster contractions that occur in

              and deactivation (as in preventing urinary incontinence in
              coughing or sneezing). Numerical simulations are presented for
              the active deformation of the levator ani muscle under constant

              mixed types of urinary incontinence diagnosed with urodynamic
              studies. METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was designed in
              collaboration with the radiology department. We recruited only
              patients who had undergone static pelvic MRI to determine the
              etiology of pelvic pain and exclude gynecologic disorders. The
              study included 45 women diagnosed with stress or mixed-type
              urinary incontinence based on pelvic examination and urodynamic
              testing without symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse and 40
              continent controls. We evaluated the images of pelvic static MRI
              of all patients to measure the thickness of the pelvic floor
              muscles with the radiologist by using an image analysis
              workstation retrospectively. RESULTS: The right and left

              significantly lower in the urinary incontinence group than in the

              can be demonstrated by a static pelvic MRI, and this can be used

              with and without prolapse to test pathomechanism hypotheses of

              construct FE models by customizing the base model with desired

              structures from three support subsystems which can be customized
              based on magnetic resonance image measurements in women with and
              without prolapse. The customizable structural parameters include
              presence of levator ani (LA) avulsion, hiatus size, anterior
              vaginal wall dimension, attachment fascia length and apical
              location in addition to the tissue material properties and

              normal model with intact muscle had the smallest exposed vaginal
              length of 11 mm, while the bilateral avulsion produced the
              largest exposed vaginal length at 24 mm. The unilateral avulsion
              model had an exposed vaginal length of 18 mm and also
              demonstrated a tipped perineal body similar to that seen in
              clinical observation. Increasing the hiatus size, vaginal wall
              length and fascia length also resulted in worse pelvic floor

  author   = "DelPrete, Hillary",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The shape and size of the pelves of males and females
              differ, due in part, to the differing constraints of the sexes.
              Previous research has demonstrated that many factors impact
              pelvic morphology, thereby it is not surprising that there is
              pelvic variation within and across populations. Because of this
              variation, pelvic measures that are sexually dimorphic also
              differ by population. However, measures that are critical for
              reproduction should remain sexually dimorphic, regardless of
              circumstance. This study examines pelvic dimorphisms across six
              samples to determine if they are consistent. METHODS:
              Twenty-three pelvic measurements were collected from 668
              individuals from six skeletal populations. Multiple t-tests were
              run within samples to determine which traits were dimorphic.
              Further, an index value was computed for each variable to examine
              and to classify level of dimorphism; values were classified as
              high, moderate, or low. All results were compared across samples.
              RESULTS: Ten measures remained dimorphic across every population;
              females were consistently larger for posterior spaces of the
              inlet, midplane, and outlet, bi-spinous diameter, transverse
              diameter of the outlet, and circumference of the midplane. Males
              were consistently larger for anterior space of the outlet, pelvic
              breadth, iliac length, and pelvic depth. Index values varied
              across populations; however, level of dimorphism remained
              consistent. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that some
              measures of the pelvic canal have a higher selection intensity
              than others. Further, variability in index values suggests that
              while maintaining the statistically significant presence of
              dimorphism, there is a degree of flexibility in the degree of
              dimorphism.",

              evolutionary trade-off between two competing demands: a pelvis
              wide enough to permit the birth of large-brained infants, and
              narrow enough for efficient bipedal locomotion. This trade-off,
              known as the obstetrical dilemma, is invoked to explain the
              relative difficulty of human childbirth and differences in
              locomotor performance between men and women. The basis for the
              obstetrical dilemma is a standard static biomechanical model that
              predicts wider pelves in females increase the metabolic cost of
              locomotion by decreasing the effective mechanical advantage of
              the hip abductor muscles for pelvic stabilization during the
              single-leg support phase of walking and running, requiring these
              muscles to produce more force. Here we experimentally test this
              model against a more accurate dynamic model of hip abductor
              mechanics in men and women. The results show that pelvic width
              does not predict hip abductor mechanics or locomotor cost in
              either women or men, and that women and men are equally efficient
              at both walking and running. Since a wider birth canal does not
              increase a woman's locomotor cost, and because selection for
              successful birthing must be strong, other factors affecting
              maternal pelvic and fetal size should be investigated in order to
              help explain the prevalence of birth complications caused by a

              models, including the pubovisceral muscle and pelvic bones were
              built from magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired at rest. The
              numerical simulation of Valsalva maneuver was based on the finite
              element method and the material constants were determined for
              different constitutive models (Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin and
              Yeoh) using an iterative process. The material constants (MPa)

               after vaginal delivery. However, only few and incongruent data
               on the incidence and pathogenesis of postpartum incontinence are
               available. This study examined the effects of vaginal delivery
               on anal continence prospectively. METHODS: In 42 unselected
               women anal vector manometry and endoanal ultrasonography were
               performed, and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) and
               rectal sensibility were measured in the 32th week of pregnancy
               and 6 weeks after delivery. Continence was evaluated according
               to the Kelly-Holschneider score. Patients with occult sphincter
               defects were additionally followed-up 12 weeks after vaginal
               delivery. To exclude any effect of pregnancy alone ten patients
               with elective cesarian section served as controls. RESULTS:
               Overall continence after vaginal delivery did not differ
               significantly from that before delivery, there was a significant
               reduction in postpartum anal squeeze and resting pressures in
               all patients. Obstetric tears of grade III or IV occurred in 9\%
               of the patients. Endosonography revealed occult lesions of the
               internal and external anal sphincter in an additional 19\% of
               women who clinically seemed to have an intact sphincter.
               Manometric results and continence in these women did not differ
               significantly from those with intact sphincter and remained
               unchanged after 12 weeks. PNTML and rectal sensibility were not
               affected by vaginal delivery. After cesarian section there were
               no changes in continence, anal pressures, rectal sensibility, or
               PNTML. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal delivery leads to direct mechanical
               trauma to the anal sphincters, while stretch and distension of
               the pudendal nerve seem to be of minor importance. Only endoanal

              measurements obtained from 30 healthy adults walking at two
              comfortable speeds. We predicted that a larger component of

              selection for a large neonatal brain and a narrow,

              hominin ``solution'' is to truncate gestation, resulting in an

              that these high rates are a direct consequence of the distinct
              characteristics of human obstetric selection. Neonatal size
              relative to the birth-relevant maternal dimensions is highly
              variable and positively associated with reproductive success
              until it reaches a critical value, beyond which natural delivery
              becomes impossible. As a consequence, the symmetric phenotype
              distribution cannot match the highly asymmetric, cliff-edged
              fitness distribution well: The optimal phenotype distribution
              that maximizes population mean fitness entails a fraction of
              individuals falling beyond the ``fitness edge'' (i.e., those with
              fetopelvic disproportion). Using a simple mathematical model, we
              show that weak directional selection for a large neonate, a
              narrow pelvic canal, or both is sufficient to account for the
              considerable incidence of fetopelvic disproportion. Based on this

               validated questionnaire among 25- to 84-year-old women. Women
               screened positive for each disorder based on reported symptoms
               and their degree of bother. Covariates were assessed through
               self-report. Prevalence of each disorder was compared across
               four 15-year age groups using chi(2) tests. Multiple logistic
               regression was used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Among
               4,103 women (mean age 56.5+/-15.8 years), the prevalence of SUI
               was 15\%, OAB 13\%, POP 6\%, anal incontinence 25\%, and 37\%

               limited range of relevant variation. Here, we outline a
               comparative strategy to study the evolution of human childbirth
               and to test existing hypotheses in primates and other mammals.
               METHODS: We combined a literature review with comparative
               analyses of neonatal and female body and brain mass, using three
               existing datasets. We also present images of bony pelves of a
               diverse sample of taxa. RESULTS: Bats, certain non-human
               primates, seals, and most ungulates, including whales, have much
               larger relative neonatal masses than humans, and they all differ
               in their anatomical adaptations for childbirth. Bats, as a
               group, are particularly interesting in this context as they give
               birth to the relatively largest neonates, and their pelvis is
               highly dimorphic: Whereas males have a fused symphysis, a
               ligament bridges a large pubic gap in females. The resulting
               strong demands on the widened and vulnerable pelvic floor likely
               are relaxed by roosting head-down. CONCLUSIONS: Parturition has
               constituted a strong selective force in many non-human
               placentals. We illustrated how the demands on pelvic morphology
               resulting from locomotion, pelvic floor stability, childbirth,
               and perhaps also erectile function in males have been traded off
               differently in mammals, depending on their locomotion and
               environment. Exploiting the power of a comparative approach, we

              precise frequency of obstructed labor is difficult to estimate
              because of the widespread use of cesarean delivery for
              indications other than proven cephalopelvic disproportion, but it
              has been estimated that at least 1 million mothers per year are
              affected by this disorder worldwide. Why is the fit between the
              fetus and the maternal pelvis so tight? Why did evolution not
              lead to a greater safety margin, as in other primates? Here we
              review current research and suggest new hypotheses on the
              evolution of human childbirth and pelvic morphology. In 1960,
              Washburn suggested that this obstetrical dilemma arose because
              the human pelvis is an evolutionary compromise between two
              functions, bipedal gait and childbirth. However, recent
              biomechanical and kinematic studies indicate that pelvic width
              does not considerably affect the efficiency of bipedal gait and
              thus is unlikely to have constrained the evolution of a wider
              birth canal. Instead, bipedalism may have primarily constrained
              the flexibility of the pubic symphysis during pregnancy, which
              opens much wider in most mammals with large fetuses than in
              humans. We argue that the birth canal is mainly constrained by
              the trade-off between 2 pregnancy-related functions: while a
              narrow pelvis is disadvantageous for childbirth, it offers better
              support for the weight exerted by the viscera and the large human
              fetus during the long gestation period. We discuss the
              implications of this hypothesis for understanding pelvic floor
              dysfunction. Furthermore, we propose that selection for a narrow
              pelvis has also acted in males because of the role of pelvic
              floor musculature in erectile function. Finally, we review the
              cliff-edge model of obstetric selection to explain why evolution
              cannot completely eliminate cephalopelvic disproportion. This
              model also predicts that the regular application of life-saving
              cesarean delivery has evolutionarily increased rates of
              cephalopelvic disproportion already. We address how evolutionary
              models contribute to understanding and decision making in

  abstract = "The bony pelvis of adult humans exhibits marked sexual
              dimorphism, which is traditionally interpreted in the framework
              of the ``obstetrical dilemma'' hypothesis: Giving birth to
              large-brained/large-bodied babies requires a wide pelvis, whereas
              efficient bipedal locomotion requires a narrow pelvis. This
              hypothesis has been challenged recently on biomechanical,
              metabolic, and biocultural grounds, so that it remains unclear
              which factors are responsible for sex-specific differences in
              adult pelvic morphology. Here we address this issue from a
              developmental perspective. We use methods of biomedical imaging
              and geometric morphometrics to analyze changes in pelvic
              morphology from late fetal stages to adulthood in a
              known-age/known-sex forensic/clinical sample. Results show that,
              until puberty, female and male pelves exhibit only moderate
              sexual dimorphism and follow largely similar developmental
              trajectories. With the onset of puberty, however, the female
              trajectory diverges substantially from the common course,
              resulting in rapid expansion of obstetrically relevant pelvic
              dimensions up to the age of 25-30 y. From 40 y onward females
              resume a mode of pelvic development similar to males, resulting
              in significant reduction of obstetric dimensions. This complex
              developmental trajectory is likely linked to the pubertal rise
              and premenopausal fall of estradiol levels and results in the
              obstetrically most adequate pelvic morphology during the time of
              maximum female fertility. The evidence that hormones mediate
              female pelvic development and morphology supports the view that
              solutions of the obstetrical dilemma depend not only on selection
              and adaptation but also on developmental plasticity as a response

               Anthropoid Primates",
  author    = "Moffett, Elizabeth A",
  abstract  = "It has long been noted that the human female birth canal is well
               adapted to giving birth to large-brained neonates. However,
               several species of nonhuman primates give birth to large-headed
               neonates compared to the maternal birth canal. The presence of
               such large cephalopelvic proportions in nonhuman primates
               presents the question of whether dimorphism in the birth canals
               of these other species is related to obstetric demand, as such
               dimorphism is presumed to be in humans. In this study, the
               hypothesis that either the presence or magnitude of dimorphism
               in the birth canal is related to large cephalopelvic proportions
               among anthropoid primates is directly tested. This study shows
               that birth canal dimorphism is common among anthropoids
               regardless of cephalopelvic proportions, but taxa with large
               cephalopelvic proportions have a higher magnitude of dimorphism
               than those that give birth to relatively small-headed neonates.
               Furthermore, humans have exceptionally high levels of dimorphism
               that cannot be explained based on our large cephalopelvic
               proportions alone. Anat Rec, 300:870-889, 2017. \copyright{}
